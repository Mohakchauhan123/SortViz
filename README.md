## Overview

The Sorting Algorithms Visualizer is a web application that helps users understand the working of various sorting algorithms through visualizations. The application provides a step-by-step demonstration of how each algorithm processes data, making it easier to grasp the concepts behind sorting.

## Features

- **Visualize Sorting Algorithms**: See how different sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort operate on an array of data.
- **Interactive Interface**: Start, pause, and step through the sorting process to closely examine each step of the algorithm.
- **Complexity Analysis**: Get detailed information about the time and space complexity of each sorting algorithm.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is fully responsive, providing an optimal experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Sorting Algorithms Implemented

- **Bubble Sort**
- **Selection Sort**
- **Insertion Sort**
- **Merge Sort**
- **Quick Sort**

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd SortTutor
    ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React.js, HTML, CSS
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, Custom CSS
- **Routing**: React Router

## Usage

- Select a sorting algorithm from the navigation menu.
- View the algorithm's description and time complexity details.
- Watch the sorting process with visualizations.
- Use the "Start", "Pause", and "Step" controls to interact with the sorting process.
